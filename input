When a user presses the tab key within an interactive
 command-shell, Bash automatically uses command line
 completion to match partly typed program names,
 filenames and variable names. The Bash command
-line completion system is very flexible 
and customizable, and is often packaged 
with functions that complete arguments and 
filenames for specific programs and tasks.
